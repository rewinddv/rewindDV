/**
 * @class TopologyManager
 * @brief Builds immutable topology snapshots from validated Self-ID captures.
 *
 * Invalid Self-ID input is treated as a hard topology failure for the current
 * generation. The manager never falls back to a stale snapshot after a reset.
 *
 * @par Threading contract (load-bearing — do not break)
 * TopologyManager is **confined to the dext's "Default" IODispatchQueue** and is
 * NOT internally synchronized. Every writer and every reader runs on that one
 * serial queue, which is what makes access to @ref latest_ and @ref badIRMFlags_
 * race-free:
 *   - Writers: UpdateFromSelfID / InvalidateForBusReset — driven by the bus-reset
 *     FSM off the OHCI interrupt dispatch source, which is created on the Default
 *     queue (InterruptManager::Initialise <- ctx.workQueue).
 *   - Readers: LatestSnapshot (FireWireBusImpl speed/hop queries; ControllerCore::
 *     LatestTopology used by the user-client handlers and StatusPublisher) and the
 *     bad-IRM flag accessors. The user client's ExternalMethod has no queue of its
 *     own, so it too runs on the Default queue; ROM scanning uses scheduler->Queue()
 *     which is bound to the same Default queue.
 * Because all of the above share one serial queue, LatestSnapshot() may safely
 * return the snapshot by value: the copy never overlaps a concurrent assignment.
 *
 * The side queues that exist (com.asfw.avc.rescan, com.asfw.fcp.timeout,
 * com.asfw.isoch.txverify, and the audio dext) must NOT call into TopologyManager.
 * If a future caller genuinely needs off-Default access (e.g. a dedicated BM/IRM
 * worker queue), the correct fix is to guard latest_/badIRMFlags_ with an IOLock
 * (DriverKit primitive) — not to rely on the by-value copy. Until then, no lock.
