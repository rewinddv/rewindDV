/**
 * \brief RAII handle for DMA payload memory.
 *
 * Manages lifecycle of DMA-allocated payload buffers. Provides automatic
 * cleanup semantics compatible with Transaction ownership model.
 *
 * **Design**
 * - Movable but not copyable (unique ownership)
 * - Automatically clears state on destruction
 * - Zero overhead when moved (just pointer + size)
 * - Type-safe (can't accidentally use after free)
 *
 * **Phase 2.0 Memory Model**
 * DMAMemoryManager is a slab allocator that doesn't support individual Free().
 * Memory is reclaimed when the entire slab is destroyed during AsyncSubsystem
 * shutdown. PayloadHandle tracks ownership and prevents double-use, but doesn't
 * actually free memory in its destructor.
 *
 * **Usage**
 * \code
 * // Allocate payload
 * auto handle = payloadMgr->Allocate(1024);
 * if (!handle) {
 *     return kIOReturnNoMemory;
 * }
 *
 * // Access payload
 * std::span<uint8_t> data = handle->Data();
 * std::memcpy(data.data(), buffer, size);
 *
 * // Automatic cleanup on scope exit (clears handle state)
 * \endcode
 *
 * **Thread Safety**
 * Not thread-safe. Caller must ensure exclusive access during lifetime.
