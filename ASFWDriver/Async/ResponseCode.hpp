/**
 * \brief Response codes for AR Request handlers per IEEE 1394-1995 Table 6-3
 *
 * These values match Linux firewire and Apple IOFireWireFamily implementations.
 * Handlers return these codes to indicate success/failure; the AR infrastructure
 * uses them to construct WrResp packets.
 *
 * **Design**: Handlers are protocol-agnostic - they only choose the rCode.
 * The AR infrastructure (PacketRouter/ResponseSender) owns the policy of
 * whether to actually send a WrResp (e.g., skips broadcast destID=0xFFFF).
